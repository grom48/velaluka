    answer:
      "A reservation must do so in writing (via e-mail or GSM). Changes constitute a change in the renters name or the date of the commencement and/or end date of the service. If the renter cancels a reservation up to 14 days before the designated pick-up time a 15,00 â‚¬ cancellation fee will be charged. If the renter cancels a reservation within 14 days before the designated pick-up time, does not pick up the rental car or cancels reservation after the designated pick-up time a 20% cancellation fee of the total amount of the reservation will be charged.",
